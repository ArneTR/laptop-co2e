# Laptop carbon footprints

This is a list of carbon footprints compiled from various sources for common laptops. I have compiled these from various sources in case you need a new laptop. If you would like to add more to this list, please issue a pull request.

**kg CO2e** (kg. CO2 equivalent) is the total expected lifetime (4-year) carbon footprint of the device.

**kg CO2e w/o use** is the total footprint of the device to make it and send it to you. If your electricity sources are carbon-neutral, this number is the one that matters.

## Lenovo Thinkpad

Without use included, the best Thinkpad in this list is the Thinkpad A285, with 225.28 kg CO2e. If you want Intel (or Thunderbolt 3), your choice is the Thinkpad X280, with 257.18 kg CO2e for a newer one; the X250 is a little better at 256.88.

With use included, the best Thinkpad in this list is the X1 Carbon 6th Gen, with 333 kg CO2e (and the X280 following up with 334.)

## Apple

Macs have insanely low carbon footprints compared to respective Thinkpad models. The most carbon-friendly MacBook is the new MacBook Air, at 176kg CO2e with use and 165.44 without. It's better than every other computer in this list.

Note the four-year lifespan of these. **These Apple products are virtually nonrepairable**, so the lifetime of them will likely be much less than a Thinkpad. Keep that in mind - most of the footprint is up front with the laptop's manufacture. If you are keeping it for a long time, you're probably better off with the Thinkpad.
