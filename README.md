# Laptop carbon footprints

This is a list of carbon footprints compiled from various sources for common laptops. I have compiled these from various sources in case you need a new laptop. If you would like to add more to this list, please issue a pull request.

**kg CO2e** (kg. CO2 equivalent) is the total expected lifetime (4-year) carbon footprint of the device.

**kg CO2e w/o use** is the total footprint of the device to make it and send it to you. If your electricity sources are carbon-neutral, this number is the one that matters.

### Laptop footprints, in perspective

Aside from the outlier X270, the worst laptop on this list is the Thinkpad P52 at 693 kg CO2e over a four-year lifespan. [A single cheeseburger has a carbon footprint of about 4.35 kg CO2e](http://www.openthefuture.com/cheeseburger_CF.html). Buying a P52 is the same cost as eating 159 cheeseburgers over the course of that four years - or eating a single cheeseburger every 1.3 weeks. There is a reason why environmentalists push vehicle emissions first and animal agriculture second - the cost of eating _red meat_ is substantially worse than even other meat options. It is good to minimise carbon emissions wherever you can, but remember that driving less and avoiding beef consumption will drastically outweigh your laptop purchasing choices in terms of carbon footprint.
 

## tl;dr

Microsoft's Surface series beats Apple. If you can use Windows 10 Pro, the Surface series has the lowest overall manufacturing footprint in the CSR reports. Apple is a close second, with Lenovo coming in last place. Note that the Microsoft and Apple laptops are not repairable. Let's all be happy that the Thinkpad X270 is no longer in production - each one cost the world 0.8 MT CO2e.

## Apple

Macs have insanely low carbon footprints compared to respective Lenovo models. The most carbon-friendly MacBook is the new MacBook Air, at 176kg CO2e with use and 165.44 without (it's what I use as my daily laptop). While it's a good Mac, the Surface series is even better.

Note the four-year lifespan of these. **These Apple products are virtually nonrepairable**, so the lifetime of them will likely be much less than a Thinkpad or Latitude. Keep that in mind - most of the footprint is up front with the laptop's manufacture. If you are keeping it for a long time, you're probably better off with the Thinkpad.

## Dell

Dell does not produce as many carbon footprint sheets, but does for
some specific models.

The Latitude 7280/7390 has the best footprint, at 187.81 without use and
222 with use included. This may be the best all-around deal, because the
Latitude series is relatively repairable, reliable being business-class,
and gets very close to Apple's numbers.

## Lenovo Thinkpad

Without use included, the best Thinkpad in this list is the Thinkpad A285, with 225.28 kg CO2e. If you want Intel (or Thunderbolt 3), your choice is the Thinkpad X390, with 246.5 kg CO2e. However, the A285's architecture is old and it is power hungry.

With use included, the best Thinkpad in this list is the X395, with 286 kg CO2e (and the X280 following up with 334.)

## Microsoft

My girlfriend recently asked me what the carbon footprint of the Surface devices is, and I did not know. Microsoft makes this easy and [provides eco profiles for download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55974). This is a list of all Surface hardware included in that download as of 25 November 2019.

It is important to note that the Surface Pro/Go numbers are _just for the device_. The keyboard is considered an accessory and there is an associated manufacturing footprint that is not accounted for there. Microsoft's eco profiles even list the exact specs of the machines they are using for calculations. Note that while the Surface Go is definitely the lowest in this list, it's not really a developer-friendly laptop.

The same nonrepairability warning that goes into the Apple products holds true for the Surface line, as well.
